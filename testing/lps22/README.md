# LPS 22 Demonstration Library.

Work credit to Adafruit for the base library from which we have built up off of.

The teensy 4.1 loop time is 0.2895 ms at a I2C bus speed of 400 kHz with very little sensor noise.

There is sensor noise, but this is likely due to environmental factors and would be extremely difficult to filter out. The noise frequency is low.
