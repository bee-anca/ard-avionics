# LSM6DSO23 Demonstration Library.

Work credit to Adafruit for the base library from which we have built up off of.

The teensy 4.1 loop time is 2.372 ms at default I2C bus speed noticible but low sensor noise.

A DLPF can be made to decrease this sensor noise.

I2C Fast speed didn't affect the loop timing.
