# Quarternion Demonstration Library.

Work credit to LiquidCGS for the base library from which we have built up off of.

The teensy 4.1 loop time is 0.107 ms with very little sensor noise using the Madgwick filter, along with quarternion calculations.

Notable is setting the I2C clock signal to 400 kHz

The calibration process is unweidly and not usable for a rocket.

Perhaps we can use it as an example library.
